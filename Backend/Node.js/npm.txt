# npm is defined as the node package manager 
# it is a library consist many packages 

-> packages are the pre-witten code in the js like (React.js,Express.js etc).

# these are install with the help of npm of different kind of versions of different packages

-> Fisrt Visit npm website and then according to our need we can install a package

# npm install figlet ---> Example or colde to install also given on the website

We Must install it in Specific folder not anywhere for easy use

Now We must create a file (index.js) in such directory where we install the package and now use it at there and never change the code

-> package.json file is the most inp file in it

ok All the dependencies are present in the package.json and & if node module file is deleted in the folder then 
we simply write 
-> npm install bcz we have package.json which contain all the info about that module it automaticall install it



now if we want to create our own package we must create a new folder and write

npm init -----> it creates our own package.json file which having dependency of our project

When we upload data on GitHub we just want to upload the package.json not the module file 

$ npm init

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
