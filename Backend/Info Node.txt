Node is the Runtime environment of the java Script Fist We must install it then 
Check it on bash node -v command 
Navigate First to that folder in which we are using its js files and the Write

browser console but now we can work on it with bash and with the help of node

So Node have an object Process having many things inside it

To check the current working directory

node -> process.cwd();

to take the inputs from user we use process.argv

it gave the array of values ->

let name = process.argv

for(let i = 2 ; i<name.length ; i++){
    console.log("Salam ", name[i]);
}
