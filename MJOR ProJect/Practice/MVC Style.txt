MVC is the way to Structure our Code which is one of the most well known way to Structure the Code
-> MVC = Model, View, Controller

Model --> Consist the Code of Database Models
View --> Folder contains the Frontend Files Like: ejs
Controller --> Contains the Backend Codes like : Async Functions in the Routes

Routes Folder Consists only the code for Routes & Controller Folder having Data which Module.exports of Backend Code of Routes

Something Like this:

// Delete Route
module.exports.Delete = async (req, res, next) => {
    let { id } = req.params;
    await list.findByIdAndDelete(id);
    req.flash("Success","Location Deleted!");
    res.redirect("/listing");
}

// Delete Route
route.delete("/:id",isLoggedIn, isAdmin, wrapAsync(Delete));

Require it in main File and Just Simply Use it to make a Code more Structural

As Same we set the Reviews CRUD with this Structure
