Hashing Function:
-> We never Store a password in simple or as it is form in database of the user we must use the Hashing Method
-> It is a Security feature which convert simple password (HeloAli) to -> (da94u2n5934892jed024) -> this
-> Really helpful to make password secure in backend eg: SH256

-> Hashing Function having Diffrent output of every input
-> We never determine input from output
-> 923hr7834rhadf9234ojd -> is code ko decrypt kr ke ham iska msg nai pr sakte 
-> for our situation we use a slow Hashing Function bcz of Bruite-force Attacks
-> Slow Function work well in this way to avoid this type of Attacks

Salting:
-> Hashing is a Good way to secure password but it is not enough bcz many hacker create Reverse Table to
-> decrypt the Hased password

-> Salting is the method to add some string in the orignal password & then Hash it to make it more secure
-> Ab password hn (Ali) -> Hmaraii Salted String hn (%^&-) --> Isko ham password me kahii bhi add kr ke 
-> isko Hash kr de gay (Ali%^&-) ---> (%^&-Ali) Something like this, then ab isko dcrypt krna 
-> impossible ho jaye gay this is called salting or ye sab kam hamray Passport name ka package kr deta hn
