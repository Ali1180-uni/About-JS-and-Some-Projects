Express is the Framework which is used to perform Server-Side Programming

-> Redirect to that Folder/Directory First

-> npm init and create our own package.json 

npm install express --------> To install the Express

-> Golbally install Nodemon to avoid to restart Server again and again 

-> npm install -g nodemon // Run Bash as administator

-> Press Ctrl+c to stop the Server

Startup Code :

const Express = require("express); 
const app = Express(); // Name is Always app

const port = 3000; // Its value is also be 8080 It is the Port value Entry point of Server

app.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log(`Server is at : ${port}`);
});

//For Sending Request to the Server we are using the (use)-->Keyword

app.use((req,res)=>{ // First Parameter is Request & Second is Response
    console.log("Request is received ");
});

// Now for Giving Response to our Request we use (.send)---> Method
It Respond in --> HTML,JSON,TEXT

let obj = {
    UID: 1134621560,
    id: "Inv.Algebra"
};

app.use((req,res)=>{ // First Parameter is Request & Second is Response
    console.log("Request is received ");
    // res.send("Your Request is recieved"); // Send is the method of Respond which Show the data
    // res.send(obj); // Use object to show Data in Json Format --> .send() method Convert it in JSON format
    res.send("<h1>This Data Shown in HTML<h1>"); // this is how data is shown in HTML tags
});

OK there is also another Method of 
App.get() ---> Listen specific requests
App.use() ---> listen all requests

/somthing in the link defined the specific rourtes in the website link

eg : localhost:8080/home ---> specific route to Home page

Example Code

app.get("/", (req,res)=>{ // this is the Root Path of the Server
    console.log("Requested Root");
    res.send("Your are on Root Page");
});

app.get("/Home", (req,res)=>{ // In this Get Request we Set the also The Route Path With Slash
    // This is the Home Page Route
    console.log("Requested Home");
    res.send("Your are on home Page");
});

app.get("/Help", (req,res)=>{
    console.log("Requested Help");
    res.send("Your are on help Page");
});

app.get("/Search", (req,res)=>{ // In this Get Request we Set the also The Route Path With Slash
    console.log("Requested Search");
    res.send("Your are on Search Page");
});

app.get('/:any', (req, res) => {  // ok if the Route path is not defines then we use the /:any in the path it is used to show the response if invalid path is entered
    res.send("The Route Path is not Exist on GET REQUEST");
});


// We can also send the Specific id and username anything other as a route path According to which request is Send and 
// Respond is shown


// if the both parameters are set then it shows the exact respond otherwise '/:any' respond is shown

-> http://localhost:8080/Ali/109

app.get("/:username/:id", (req,res)=>{ // Now Express treats path as a variable and we can access them in Request.
    let {username , id } = req.params; // req.prams consist the variables value given as a path in URL by user
    let htm = `<h1>Welcome to the page of @${username}<h1>`;
    res.send(htm);
});


Now we also manage the Query String with Express.JS

app.get("/Search", (req,res)=>{ // Acsess by /Search?q=Ali ---> or anything 
    let {Name} = req.query; // ok the Naame is same as in /Search?Name=Something ---> This Code is used to send any Query
    let htmCode = `<h1>Your Requested Query is ${Name}<h1>`;
    res.send(htmCode);
});
