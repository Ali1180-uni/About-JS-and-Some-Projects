First we have to create a Folder of our Project in which there are two files one 
which import and other which export

Import is New and Replacement version of Require and better to use

Then we must Enter some functions to export

Also create first package.json -----> npm init ---> Add the (type : Module) at the end of package.json file

Also type ->export<- keyword at the starting of every element which we want to export

Now in Main file which import other file we just write 

import {functions Which We want to import} from "./filename.js";


Example Code : 

Function file which export data :


export const sum = (a,b) =>{
    return a+b
}
export const sub = (a,b) =>{
    return a-b
}
export let g = 9.8;


File Which Import data :

import { sum } from "./func.js";

console.log(sum(3,5));

package.json : with "type" : "Module"

{
  "name": "practice-import",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "func.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Ali Rehmani",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "This is Just Practice",
  "type": "module" --------------------------> module added specifically for import & Export
}
