Fist step to add the local file for git comand is: 

-> git init

Now The comands for Remote origin it is the link First we create the Repo from github then paste its link ate here

-> git remote add origin <link>

To verify the link

-> git remote -v

To check all the commits in file 

-> git log // The Oldest commit shows at last of the terminal

First To check the version comand

-> git --version

To check the git comands

-> git

To config the Git Bash

-> git config --global user.name "Ali"
-> git config --global user.email "aliuni1180@gmail.com"

To clone the Repositry 

-> git clone (http link without qoutes)

Check the Status of Git files 

-> git status

Too add some type of file before commit

-> git add file-name
eg: git add index.html

-> (add .) ----> this comand is used to add all the files.

To commit all the changes 

-> git commit -m "Some kind of msg" -------> Enter a message is Essential
-> git commit -am "Some kind of msg" -------> used to add and commit both

To push the code 

-> git push origin main

To check the branch name

-> git branch

To change the branch name 

-> git branch -M main -----> it is the orignal name always be change it for good practice

To create a new branch

-> git checkout -b <-new branch name-> like : feature & bug fix. etc

To Switch the Branch 

-> git checkout <-branch name->

To Delete the Branch

-> git branch -d //Advice to Checkout first on main branch then Delete the other branch

----------<When we create a new branch and push something my must make it upstream>--------

-> git push --set-upstream origin <-Branch name-> //feature

Pull Request is used to merge the branches on Github  with specific comments after
it we can delete the branch these are done remotely on Github not on our local system

Pull comand ----------> used to make the remote chnages on local system

-> git pull origin main

To find the Difference between branches

-> git diff <-branch name-> 

To merge the branches comand

-> git merge <-branch name->

if the conflict occur then the vs code automatically show us error and always it merge from main
branch and adn then VS code show us code in our file and ask us which change you want then
edit it according to our need

Add, Comit & Push it for later use

Now if we want to Go back to previous changes 

Go back to previous add 

-> git reset <-file name->
-> git reset // these both just to resrt the most recent add only (not commit).

Go back to previous commit

-> git reset HEAD~1 ---> to just go back to only one recent commit

when we want to go back to many recent commit so we just want to add the comit hash

-> git reset <-comit hash-> // it just unstage the hashed commit only
-> git reset --hard <-commit hash-> // to remove also all the commits to this particular comit hash

    WE GET COMMMIT HASH FROM -> git log (comand)

GIT HASH FORMAT: 6aee8af77ab5c087df8d041ef7953ef67e2a6c18


Fork is used to clone the existing Repositry in Github like NODE.js offical Repositry
now we can make changes in it and also set pull request to officials to merge it
it might be used to contribute to others project
