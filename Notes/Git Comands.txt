Fist step to add the local file for git comand is: 

-> git init

Now The comands for Remote origin it is the link First we create the Repo from github then paste its link ate here

-> git remote add origin <link>

To verify the link

-> git remote -v

First To check the version comand

-> git --version

To check the git comands

-> git

To config the Git Bash

-> git config --global user.name "Ali"
-> git config --global user.email "aliuni1180@gmail.com"

To clone the Repositry 

-> git clone (http link without qoutes)

Check the Status of Git files 

-> git status

Too add some type of file before commit

-> git add file-name
eg: git add index.html

-> (add .) ----> this comand is used to add all the files.

To commit all the changes 

-> git commit -m "Some kind of msg" -------> Enter a message is Essential

To push the code 

-> git push origin main

To check the branch name

-> git branch

To change the branch name 

-> git branch -M main -----> it is the orignal name always be change it for good practice

To create a new branch

-> git checkout -b <-new branch name-> like : feature & bug fix. etc

To Switch the Branch 

-> git checkout <-branch name->

To Delete the Branch

-> git branch -d //Advice to Checkout first on main branch then Delete the other branch

----------<When we create a new branch and push something my must make it upstream>--------

-> git push --set-upstream origin <-Branch name-> //feature

Pull Request is used to merge the branches on Github  with specific comments after
it we can delete the branch these are done remotely on Github not on our local system

Pull comand ----------> used to make the remote chnages on local system

-> git pull origin main

To find the Difference between branches

-> git diff <-branch name-> 

To merge the branches comand

-> git merge <-branch name->

if the conflict occur then the vs code automatically show us error and always it merge from main
branch and adn then VS code show us code in our file and ask us which change you want then
edit it according to our need

Add, Comit & Push it for later use
