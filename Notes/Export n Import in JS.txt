Ok We can also tranfer the data of one file to another file in the same direcotry with the help of 

module.exports = value/object/variable

Steps -> Create a JS file in Same directory 

EXAMPLE CODE -> File Which Export data

let sum = (a,b) => {return a + b}
let sub = (a,b) => {return a - b}
let mul = (a,b) => {return a * b}

const g = 9.8;
const PI = 3.14;

// module.exports = 123; //This Value is return when it is required by another file

//Also Create an object of all the values and pass it to it 

const obj = {
    sum: sum,
    sub: sub,
    mul: mul,
    g: g,
    PI: PI
};

module.exports = obj; // File Passed to another file by required keyword used in that file which import data

EXAMPLE CODE -> File which Import data

let files = require("./Math"); //./filename -> Path of file from which we export data in same directory

console.log(files.sum(4,5));
console.log(files.PI);
console.log(files.g);
console.log(files.mul(2,7));


just with comand of -> node filename.js


So Now We can also Export the data from one complete Folder/Directory to another File

-> First Create a Folder and Create Specific files in it like 
Student 1.js ,Student 2.js , Student 3.js .............

Also Create an Index.js file must with same name which collect all the data of all the files and 
represent that folder to import the info (IMPORTANT)---->!!!!!!!!!

EXAMPLE: --->

File 1: 
let obj = {
    name: "ALi",
    age: 19
};

module.exports = obj;

File 2:
let obj = {
    name: "Aiza",
    age: 18
};

module.exports = obj;

File 3:
let obj = {
    name: "ALiza",
    age: 15
};

module.exports = obj;



Main INDEX File having Array of all Requires files and nestedly export then to another file

INDEX FILE: 
let Stu1 = require("./Student 1");
let Stu2 = require("./Student 2");
let Stu3 = require("./Student 3");

let data = [Stu1,Stu2,Stu3];

module.exports = data;

Now The Specific Folder path in which these files are present included INDEX.js can be given to that file which import 
data 

Import file -> CODE

let data = require("./Students"); //./filename -> Path of file from which we export data in same directory

console.log(data[1].name); //Or Specifically any index of array and key of any object
