Ok Some basic comands About terminal are as follow 

                      Folder == Directory

ls(List Items) ---> this is used to listout all the Items in Directory
~ ---> represent the Home Directory Most Parent Folder
pwd(Present Work Directory) ---> tell us in which folder/Directory we are present

if we want to move in and out the Directories

cd(current Directory) folder-name ---> this comand move us to that folder
cd .. ---> this comand send us back to previous folder

Eg: cd web/About Js/DOM ---> move in multiple Directories
Eg: cd ../../..

if the path is started with / --> then it is used to move anywhere known as Absolute link
if the path is relitive then we are restrict to move only front and back not anywhere

Absolute path : cd /users/download/music --> Redirect Directly withou restriction
relitive path : without / ---> cd web/About Js/DOM

if we just write / then we redirect to root Directory
if we just write ~ then we redirect to home Directory

Create a new Folder ------->
mkdir folder-name  ----> create the new folder in specific Directory

There are some flags in comands which gave the extra info or functionality to the comands

man ls(or any other comand(pwd)) ----> it gives the total info about this comand

-a, -l these are the flags which are used to check the extra info after giving it to comand

eg: ls -l ----> this can provide the extra info

Create the Files with terminal

Touch filename.extenstion ------> create the file in that Directory

eg: touch index.html ->> etc....


                           --------------->> Disclaimer

THE FILES DELETE WITH THE REMOVE COMANDS CANNOT BE RECOVERED EVER THATS WHY USE IT CAREFULLY

rm file-name --------> Remove the Files
rmdir folder-name --------> Remove the Folder
rm -rf Folder-name  ---------> Remove the Folder or any file having content in it Forcefully

                  These actions are permanent & Never be RECOVERED
