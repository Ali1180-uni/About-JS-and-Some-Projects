Flex
Only the Direct childs of the container can only become the flex items of the flex container
flex display is use to make the containers flexible
flex direction show its direction (Row,Column)-Reverse
Justify content is to set the div Start-End-Center & Also for Space
Space between = make the extra spaces between the div's
Space around = give the space between them and also divide the 2 parts of extra space half and half around them
Space evenly = give the exact same space around and between all the div's
Flex wrap = is to manage the div's if they have more width or height i shift it on another line (nowrap-wrap-wrap reverse)
Align items is to Align the div's according to cross axis and also i works only when there is space between them
Align content is the same thing like the justify but in cross axis
Align Self is to set the Specific Div's for is property
Align self> Align content
To set the Size of specific div we use Flex basis if in Row it set for width and if in height it sets for Column
we also make the flex grow for the specific div in values like Flex-Grow:1,2,3,4 ...;(for Extra Space) & Flex-Shrink:1,2,3,4 ...;(for overflow) and also use max-width & min-width to limits and conditons the width or height for specifc point

GRID
display: grid;
it is use to display data in the form of 2D both rows & column 
Grid Template is to set the div's in Rows & column According to the space
grid-templete-(row & Column) 100px 100px 100px ... <--(how many rows or columns you want to create)
auto auto auto... is used to set it according to the space of container number of auto or pixel values tell us in it how many rows & columns you want to create.
another helpful method is to use this shorthand grid-templete-(row & column): repeat(  --> number of row/column you want to create <-- ,  --> 1fr=divided equal space <-- , --> 2fr= double spcae <--)

column & Row-gap is used to gave the space between rows & columns LIKE column-gap:10px; etc
SHORTHAND: grid-gap: rowgap columngap --> 10px 30px && grid-gap: rowgapcolumngap --> 10px --> both with same gap 
Grid-column-start & End (LINES) tells that how much area occupied by the single div and also it is applied for the columns
Grid-column & Row : start column / End column (ROW also)

Grid properties in which Justify item is used to set the content of complete container horizontal & justify self is for single div (Start-End-Center)
SAME : align item is set for whole container vertically and align self is for single div vertically (Start-End-Center)
