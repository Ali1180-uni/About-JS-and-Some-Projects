EJS --- > Embedded JavaScript Templates

npm install ejs ----> Download the Package First

It is used to Create the templates of a single Page 
As we know that there are many instagram pages so The Developer never Create HTML for each new page.
He just Create a Templates of that page and these were uses for each new page of user

Express Requires the EJS internally, There is no need to Require it when using Express

Ok EJS use to Render the Complete HTML Pages 

Step 1: Set the app variable to --> app.set("view engine","ejs"); --> Templates which help to Render is EJS ->Meaning

Step 2: Create a folder views ---> same name contains .ejs files which are basically HTML files --> That Renders

// To send the complete HTML files from app.send ----> is not possible so we use Ejs Method

Step 3: Write the code
            
    app.get("/",(req,res)=>{ 
        res.render("home.ejs"); // Render is used with ejs & Automatically Checks in Views folder for files
    });
            
Step 4: Express Automatically Check the Veiws Folder and Check the Home.ejs file in it 


Step 5: We can Access it only From its parent folder Which EJS ---> It means it trying to Find Views folder only 
        When we run command from EJS folder if we (cd .. ) --> Go Back 
        and now Run the Command the It trying to Search the view folder there So, We must Call a Function Path
        to Access it anywhere

If we do this  Error: Failed to lookup view "home.ejs" in views directory "D:\Web\About JavaScript\views" --> Occur

// To Access File From Anywhere 

Step 6: Require a Path Package 

const path = require("path");

app.set("views", path.join(__dirname,"/views")); // __dirname for Folder & __Filename for Files Access from anywhere

__dirname ----> represent the Current Working directory of that File in which these lines Written
EJS is --> cwd of index.js & views Folder present in ----> EJS

"views", path.join(__dirname,"/views") --> This line Said don't Find Views in that directory where comand is Run
                                        Find it there Where -->  __dirname = index.js -->  is present

Just Write these lines to universally Access these lines by Path 
-> nodemon EJS/ index.js

STEPS:
1. To Require the Path:
const path = require("path");

2. Then set it to That Directory:
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname,"/views"));

// If a single line of code make error in EJS All code after it make or Show Error

If we want to Add the CSS & Images File with the EJS So we Must Create a Public Folder same as Views

-> The Public Folder consist of CSS & IMAGES & JS files

-> First Create a Folder name Public & create the sub Folders ->  Stylesheet,Images & JavaScript

Now we must connect this Folder with the EJS by index.js 

-> app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,"public"))); ----> This Folder Connect the EJS by this code

Now we can link the Stylesheet & Images & JavaScript

-> For Images --> <img src = "/Folder-Name/File-Name" />

In HTML eg:
For CSS --> <link rel = "Stylesheet" herf = "/Stylesheet/style.css />
For Images --> <img src = "/Images/img.png" />
For JavaScript --> <script src = "/JavaScript/app.js />

Folders Present in the Public Folder and these files are Present in it.
If we never create the Folder so we must Just Write.

In HTML eg:
For CSS --> <link rel = "Stylesheet" herf = "/style.css />
For Images --> <img src = "/img.png" />
For JavaScript --> <script src = "/app.js />


Always use for Views === app.set("views",path.join(__dirname,"views"));
Always use for public === app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,"public")));
