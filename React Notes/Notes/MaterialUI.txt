-> Material UI is a Framework like the Bootstrap in React which is used to use the pre-build component which are purely build in React

USE of Material UI:-
Install Material UI, the world's most popular React UI framework.
-> npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

Also it has dependencies like if we want to use the buttons and icons and also the fonts we must install them first and must
expand the documentation and imports its comonent from there
-> Basically it use the emotion framework which works better with React

-> Also its use the Roboto Font by default and also we must install them also and icons for use

Roboto Font: npm install @fontsource/roboto
imports them like this:-
import '@fontsource/roboto/300.css';
import '@fontsource/roboto/400.css';
import '@fontsource/roboto/500.css';
import '@fontsource/roboto/700.css';

imports for simple Buttons with icons:-

import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import DeleteIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Delete';
import SendIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Send';
import Stack from '@mui/material/Stack';

export default function IconLabelButtons() {
  return (
    <Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
      <Button variant="outlined" startIcon={<DeleteIcon />}>
        Delete
      </Button>
      <Button variant="contained" endIcon={<SendIcon />}>
        Send
      </Button>
    </Stack>
  );
}

This is How we can Add the icons and Button Component in the React from the MaterialUI Framework
